# Dragon-Game
Dragon Game using HTML + JavaScript.

As we all know Space is used to play this game, press space for jumping the dragon and cross the hurdles without touching them and to increase your score more.

Each part of this game contains a piace of dragon-game. There has added some addition code with old part to get next part of the code. There are comments in code and images (output of each html file) to understand code. Video is also there for getting final result of the code.

Credits goes to Rishabh Jain from Coding Club India for this code.
